# [Title]: 
## Spam_filter_pyspark
# [Description] : 
### In this project, we are tackling the challenge of spam email classification using PySpark RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets).
### Our objective is to develop an effective classifier that can accurately distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones.
### To achieve this, we are leveraging the power of PySpark, a distributed computing framework that allows us to process large-scale datasets efficiently. 
### By utilizing RDDs, we can perform parallel and fault-tolerant operations on the email data, enabling us to handle the high volume of emails effectively.
# [Technologies]
### pyspark
### logistic regression
# [Content] : 
### requirements.txt : a file with all packages you need to run the project.
### model.py : python file with runnable code.
### Ham.txt : text file with non-spam emails as an email per line. 
### Spam.txt : text file with spam emails as an email per line. 
# [How to run] :
-- First, create a virtual environment and install all the packages in the requirements.txt file using pip.
-- Make sure spark and JDK is installed on your machine and the environment variables for each one are defined.
-- Run model.py on your machine to create, train, and test your model accuracy.
